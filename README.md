# Bank_Loan_Dashboard
PROJECT OVERVIEW->
This project presents an interactive Bank Loan Dashboard built in Power BI, designed to analyze and visualize key financial and operational metrics from a bank’s loan data.
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and underwent comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing using SQL Server Studio to ensure accuracy and consistency before visualization.
The dashboard provides a 360° view of loan applications, funding performance, and borrower behavior, helping financial analysts and decision-makers derive actionable insights.

OBJECTIVES->
-To analyze loan application trends and performance metrics over time.
-To identify patterns in funded amounts, payments, interest rates, and DTI (Debt-to-Income) ratios.
-To track Month-to-Date (MTD) and Year-to-Date (YTD) loan applications and compare against previous periods.
-To visualize key insights such as total funded amount, total payment received, loan purpose distribution, average interest rate, and risk indicators.
-To improve decision-making using interactive visuals and filters for regions, loan grades, verification status, and loan purpose.

-Total Loan Applications and Month-to-Date Applications
-Total Funded Amount and Total Payment Collected
-Average Interest Rate and Average DTI (Debt-to-Income Ratio)
