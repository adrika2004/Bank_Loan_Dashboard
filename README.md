# Bank_Loan_Dashboard
PROJECT OVERVIEW->
This project presents an interactive Bank Loan Dashboard built in Power BI, designed to analyze and visualize key financial and operational metrics from a bankâ€™s loan data.
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and underwent comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing using SQL Server Studio to ensure accuracy and consistency before visualization.
The dashboard provides a 360Â° view of loan applications, funding performance, and borrower behavior, helping financial analysts and decision-makers derive actionable insights.

OBJECTIVES->

To analyze loan application trends and performance metrics over time.

To identify patterns in funded amounts, payments, interest rates, and DTI (Debt-to-Income) ratios.

To track Month-to-Date (MTD) and Year-to-Date (YTD) loan applications and compare against previous periods.

To visualize key insights such as total funded amount, total payment received, loan purpose distribution, average interest rate, and risk indicators.

To improve decision-making using interactive visuals and filters for regions, loan grades, verification status, and loan purpose.
